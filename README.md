# Dynamic_Library_Link_V1

## 📌 Purpose
This project demonstrates how to **link and use dynamic libraries (DLLs)** in C++.  
It is designed as a learning resource for developers who want to understand how to separate functionality into libraries and load them dynamically at runtime.

---

## 🧐 What Does It Do?
- Shows how to **create and compile a DLL** in C++.
- Demonstrates how to **load the DLL dynamically** in a client application.
- Provides examples of calling functions from the DLL.
- Helps beginners understand the difference between **static linking** and **dynamic linking**.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. A **dynamic library (DLL)** is created with exported functions.
2. The **main application** loads the DLL at runtime.
3. Functions inside the DLL are accessed and executed.
4. This allows modular design and reusability of code across projects.
